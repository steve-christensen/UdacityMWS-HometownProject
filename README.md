# Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Course - Hometown Project

The Hometown project provides a simple page for practicing responsive layout patterns.

In Part 2, I added the following:

* Hamburger icon for toggling menu on narrow screens.
* Placed nav menu offscreen on the right side of the page.
* Add breakpoints:
  * min-width: 420px
    * Hide the navigation toggle
    * Reformat navigation menu to horizontal menu under the header
    * Increase header logo and font sizes
    * Modified content to display by row instead of column and allow wrapping
    * Changed width for hero and weather sections to 50$
    * Changed order to allow weather to diplay to right of hero
  * min-width: 560px
    * Increase title size
    * Increase hero image size
    * Change top-stories and scores sections to 50% width
    * Restore content order to default order
  * min-width: 760px
    * Increase size of the hero image.

In Part 1, I changed the content to single-column which worked better on narrow screens, but was not responsive when the screen width changes. The heading icon and text was a bit too large on small screens as was the hero icon. I did not push these changes to GitHub.
